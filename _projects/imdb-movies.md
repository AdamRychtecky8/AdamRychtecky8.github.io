**What:** Project investigating **predictors of movie revenue** and **genre-based duration trends** using IMDb data (1960â€“2024).  

**Methods:**  
- Cleaned large IMDb dataset â†’ focused on U.S.-made films (â‰ˆ7,000 obs).  
- Built **multiple linear regression models** with stepwise selection and Box-Cox transformation.  
- Tested assumptions: normality, homoscedasticity, multicollinearity (VIF).  
- Outlier detection via Cookâ€™s Distance; re-fit models after removing ~6% influential points.  

**Key Findings:**  
- **Budget** and **Votes** were significant predictors of gross worldwide revenue.  
- **Rating** was weaker (not significant at Î±=0.05).  
- Adjusted RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.47, robust after assumption checks.  
- **Hypothesis 2:** Movie duration increased over time, with **Action** growing faster than **Drama**. By the 1990s, action movies surpassed dramas in average length.  

**Significance:**  
Provides insight into **economic drivers of box office success** and **evolving genre patterns**, demonstrating regression modeling + diagnostics on real-world data.
