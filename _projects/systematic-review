**Abstract:**  
Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). This review synthesizes evidence on **biological mechanisms**, **public health implications**, and the **economic burden** of PM2.5-related AD. Findings show that PM2.5 contributes to amyloid-Î² deposits, neuroinflammation, and elevated AD risk, particularly in populations near major roads. Economic studies from Sweden and China suggest that up to 16% of AD cases may be attributable to PM2.5, representing billions in healthcare costs.

**Methods:**  
A literature search across UCSB Library and PubMed (2015â€“2024) identified 12 peer-reviewed studies addressing biological, public health, and economic aspects of PM2.5 exposure and AD.

**Key Findings:**
- Biological: Increased amyloid-Î², neuroinflammation, and hippocampal/olfactory bulb changes.  
- Epidemiological: Higher AD hospitalization rates with closer proximity to major roads; seasonal PM2.5 fluctuations linked to neuronal apoptosis.  
- Economic: Sweden (5% of AD cases) and Sichuan, China (16.5%) attributable to PM2.5 exposure, with per-case costs > â‚¬200,000.
