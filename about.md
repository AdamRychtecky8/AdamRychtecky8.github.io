Iâ€™m currently pursuing graduate study in **Data Science** to deepen expertise in **statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, and **applied research** that bridges data-driven methods with real-world impact. My goal is to build the methodological skills needed to to address complex, data-driven problems in the real world. Graduate training will give me the foothold needed to kickstart my career, equipping me with both the technical foundation and applied perspective to the world of data.

## Focus & Interests
- **Statistical Learning & Inference:** regression, generalized linear models, time series, Bayesian methods  
- **Machine Learning:** classification, clustering, NLP, deep learning  
- **Humanâ€“AI Decision Making:** modeling collective intelligence and departures from Bayesian optimality

## Skills
**Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
**ML/Stats:** regression (GLMs), classification, clustering, time series, NLP, deep learning, Bayesian ideas  
**Tooling:** Azure AI (fundamentals), Jupyter/RStudio, Git/GitHub, reproducible workflows  
**Data:** cleaning/ETL, experiment design, EDA, visualization, reporting

## Relevant Coursework (abridged)
- Probability & Inference (PSTAT 120A/160A), Stochastic Processes, Time Series  
- Data Science Concepts & Analysis (PSTAT 100)  
- Machine Learningâ€“oriented projects (regression, ZINB, clustering, PCA)
