Hi, I‚Äôm **Adam Rychtecky** ‚Äî a senior at UC Santa Barbara studying **Statistics & Data Science** with double major in **Psychological & Brain Science**.  
I focus on applying **statistical modeling and machine learning** to complex human and societal problems, combining rigorous data analysis with cognitive science insights.  

I have hands-on experience with:  
- **Research:** Executive Research Assistant in the **Vision & Image Understanding Lab**, conducting psychophysics experiments, human‚ÄìAI decision studies, and advanced data collection/analysis.  
- **Applied Data Science:** Projects in **predictive modeling, clustering, and forecasting**, including Olympic socioeconomics (ZINB + PCA) and IMDb box office revenue modeling (multiple regression + diagnostics).  
- **Technical Skills:** Proficient in **Python, R, and SQL**, with experience in machine learning (regression, classification, NLP, deep learning), Azure AI, and reproducible research workflows.  

Right now, I‚Äôm:  
- **Researching** flexible collective intelligence with LLMs for my Honors Thesis.  
- **Building** *Dialed*, a React Native app integrating AI-driven performance coaching for athletes.  
- **Preparing** for graduate study in Data Science, with a focus on **statistical modeling, machine learning, and real-world problem solving**.
