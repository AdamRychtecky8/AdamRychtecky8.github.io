# 👋 Welcome

I’m **Adam Rychtecky**, a senior at UC Santa Barbara majoring in **Statistics & Data Science**, with additional coursework in **Psychology & Brain Science**.  
Currently, I work in the **Vision and Image Understanding Lab (VIU Lab)** as an Executive Research Assistant and I’m pursuing an **Honors Thesis** investigating *collective intelligence in humans and AI models*, inspired by Juni & Eckstein (2015).

My academic and project work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, human decision-making, and cognitive science**.  
I’m also developing **Dialed**, a React Native mobile app for mental readiness coaching in athletes, blending sports psychology with AI-driven feedback.
