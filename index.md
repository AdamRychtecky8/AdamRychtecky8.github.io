Hi, I’m **Adam Rychtecky** — Statistics & Data Science @ UCSB.  
I work at the intersection of **machine learning**, **human decision-making**, and **cognitive science**.  
Right now I’m:
- **Researching** flexible collective intelligence with LLMs (Honors Thesis, VIU Lab).
- **Building** *Dialed*, a React Native app for athlete mental readiness (AI “Caddie”, assessments, timers).
- **Honing** applied DS/ML skills (Bayesian inference, CNNs, Azure ML).
