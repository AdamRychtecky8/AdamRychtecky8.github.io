Launching this portfolio feels like crossing a threshold. In this post, I want to share **why I built it**, **how I started**, and **what I learned along the way**. Hopefully it helps you (or me, later) as I iterate forward.

## 🎯 Why Build a Portfolio Now?

When you apply to grad school or a job, people want to see more than just a resume bullet list. They want evidence: *code*, *projects*, *ideas*, *trajectory*.  
My goals for this portfolio:

- **Showcase my research + applied work** — thesis, Dialed app, data science projects.  
- **Control the narrative** — link repos, PDFs, demos in one hub.  
- **Demonstrate engineering ability** — using GitHub Pages + Markdown shows I can build something myself.  
- **Have a living “home base”** that I can always update.
