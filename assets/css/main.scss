Prompt for new agent

I am building a personal portfolio website for graduate school and employer applications using GitHub Pages + Jekyll (Minimal Mistakes theme).

Current status

Repo: a user site (adamrychtecky8.github.io).

Base site builds successfully with Minimal Mistakes (dark theme + custom CSS).

index.md is minimal (my name, intro, quick links).

No broken images (removed avatar/logo).

Custom gradient background via assets/css/main.scss.

Navigation defined in _data/navigation.yml.

projects collection is enabled in _config.yml and I plan to add one Markdown page per project (_projects/).

Resume PDF will live in /assets/resume.pdf.

Research page and blog are placeholders, not yet filled.

Goals for this project

Polish the look (dark minimal with subtle blue accents, clean typography, responsive).

Organize Projects, Research, Blog, and Resume into a coherent structure.

Ensure GitHub Pages deployment works smoothly (no duplicate names, no broken icons).

Learn how to iterate ‚Äî add/remove projects, tweak CSS, and control layout.

Optionally set up extras: analytics, custom domain, SEO.

What I need from you

Give me guidance on customizing the site (looks, navigation, content structure).

Provide clear Markdown/YAML/CSS snippets I can drop in.

Show me best practices for keeping it simple but professional (academic + recruiter friendly).

Help troubleshoot if builds fail or visuals don‚Äôt look right.

üîπ Best Way to Get the Agent Caught Up

Share the repo structure you currently have (top-level folders + key files). Example:

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _config.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _data/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _projects/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ honors-thesis.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.scss
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resume.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ projects.md


Paste the first 20‚Äì30 lines of _config.yml (it controls theme, skin, collections).

Show them your current index.md so they know how you‚Äôre handling the homepage.

Be sure to ask for material you need and I will provide the index.md below. Also reach my github repository if you can.

Hi, I‚Äôm **Adam Rychtecky** ‚Äî Statistics & Data Science @ UCSB.  
I work at the intersection of **machine learning**, **human decision-making**, and **cognitive science**.  
Right now I‚Äôm:
- **Researching** flexible collective intelligence with LLMs (Honors Thesis, VIU Lab).
- **Building** *Dialed*, a React Native app for athlete mental readiness (AI ‚ÄúCaddie‚Äù, assessments, timers).
- **Honing** applied DS/ML skills (Bayesian inference, CNNs, Azure ML).

### Quick links
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è [Projects](/projects/)
- üß† [Research](/research/)
- üìù [Blog](/posts/)
- üìÑ [Resume](/assets/resume.pdf)

If you‚Äôre a faculty member or recruiter, you‚Äôll find concise overviews on each project page with links to code and PDFs.

Thought
Awesome‚Äîhere‚Äôs a clean, copy-pasteable prompt you can hand to a fresh agent so they‚Äôre immediately useful on your portfolio repo. I‚Äôve also included a tiny ‚Äústarter kit‚Äù of code snippets the agent can reference when they respond to you.

Master prompt to give the new agent (paste as-is)
You are my site engineer for a personal portfolio built with GitHub Pages + Jekyll (Minimal Mistakes theme).

Current status
Repo: adamrychtecky8.github.io (user site).

Base site builds with Minimal Mistakes using dark styling and custom CSS.

index.md is simple (name, intro, quick links).

No images/avatars for now; removed logo to avoid broken icons.

Custom subtle blue gradient background via assets/css/main.scss.

Navigation lives in _data/navigation.yml.

projects collection is enabled in _config.yml; I‚Äôll add Markdown files in _projects/.

Resume PDF at /assets/resume.pdf.

Research page and Blog are placeholders.

Goals
Polish visuals (dark, minimal, subtle blue accents, clean typography, responsive).

Organize Projects, Research, Blog, Resume coherently.

Keep GitHub Pages builds clean (no duplicate names/icons).

Learn to iterate confidently (add/remove projects, tweak CSS, control layout).

Optional: analytics, custom domain, basic SEO.

What I need from you
Concrete guidance on customizing looks, navigation, and content structure.

Drop-in Markdown/YAML/CSS snippets.

Best practices for a professional, recruiter-friendly academic site.

Troubleshooting help if builds fail or visuals are off.

How to get caught up quickly
I will paste:

My repo tree (top-level folders + key files),

The first 20‚Äì30 lines of _config.yml,

My current index.md.

Then:

Explain what you see, call out issues, and propose specific edits (with exact file paths).

Provide minimal, copy-ready diffs or full-file snippets.

Prioritize: (A) clean header w/ no duplicate name, (B) blue-tinted dark gradient background, (C) tidy nav, (D) projects collection scaffolding.

Conventions & constraints
Theme: Minimal Mistakes; prefer config over plugins (GitHub Pages safe list).

Avoid heavy assets. No avatars for now.

Keep CSS scoped to assets/css/main.scss and variables where possible.

Use author_profile: false on pages where my name would duplicate.

Keep content tone concise and professional; defer flair to CSS.

When suggesting code, give the exact file path and a complete block that I can paste.

Deliverables you should produce
A short review of my current config with ‚Äúfix/keep‚Äù bullets.

Clean navigation.yml tailored to Projects / Research / Blog / Resume.

A minimal index.md that avoids duplicate titles and looks good in dark mode.

A main.scss snippet that implements a subtle dark ‚Üí blue gradient and tasteful accent color.

A skeleton /_projects/honors-thesis.md example (front matter + layout).

Optional toggles for analytics, SEO, and custom domain steps (CNAME).

When builds fail
Point to likely offenders (bad front matter, missing collection output, unsafe plugins, bad permalinks).

Suggest a single, safe fix first. Show a tiny reproducible edit.

Style of your responses
Start with a 3‚Äì5 item plan.

Follow with labeled code blocks and file paths.

End with a tiny ‚ÄúAfter you paste these, verify:‚Äù checklist.

I‚Äôll begin by pasting my repo tree, _config.yml head, and index.md. Use them to give precise, minimal edits.
